Runner Voice – Style rules:
- Avoid phrases that could imply lack of effort (e.g., "ridden quietly") unless you clearly explain the positive tactical intent.
- Prefer phrasing such as:
  - "Ridden to help him relax early…"
  - "Allowed to find his rhythm midfield before building through his gears…"
  - "Asked to settle early so he could breathe and switch off before improving into the race…"
